# teleport-flask-webrouter

This is a template from the app https://github.com/snipsco/teleport, that helps you to
build a flask server that is automatically deployed on a certain docker/kubernetes
config.

See for instance how this can be used to deploy a flask microservice on the snips infra via https://github.com/snipsco/teleport-snips-flask-webrouter
